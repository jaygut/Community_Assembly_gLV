# Community_Assembly_gLV
Simulating community assembly dynamics using a gLV ecological network modelling approach in combination with an adaptive radiation algorithm.  
This work is inspired on the paper: [Network spandrels reflect ecological assembly](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ele.12912)
Here I apply gLV modeling in combination with a variant of the adaptive radiation scheme (see details below) to simulate successive species invasion events starting from a minimal network composed of only a handful of competing species coexisting at equilibrium densities (see code/AssemblyDynsEcolNets_v0.ipynb).
